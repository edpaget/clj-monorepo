Deck cards represent actions you can take

Resolving Actions
Most actions will involve adding a number to a stat on the player and seeing if you beat a given value. Cards in a players deck have a number in their upper right corner, their fate value. 

When you test a skill, reveal to all players the top card from your deck and discard it. Add that card’s fate value to the stat being tested along with any modifiers. If this value is greater than 4 you are successful. If this value is 1 or less, you critically fail. 

Critical Failures:
Shot - Air Ball. Scatter the ball into any square under the hoop
Pass - Throw Away. Scatter ball into any square around the intended target.
Catch - 

Steal - Foul. Reset shot clock. Resolve Reference Interactions table
Block - Foul. Free Throw. Resolve Reference Interactions table
Check - Foul. Reset shot clock. Resolve Reference Interactions table

Standard Actions (Discard 2x to use one or play a standard action card from your hand):
Each of these are different actions but standard actions cards show them split)

Drive (up to 1/2 player speed then shoot using shot) / Rebound (move up to ½ player speed rounded down and catch a loose ball using defense) 
Shoot (using shot stat) / Check (using defense stat)
Pass (using passing stat) / Steal (using defense stat)

You can always move a player up to their move speed without playing a card or discarding. 

If a player moves with a player you control’s defensive range, you may have that player move with 

If a player shoots within a player you control’s defensive range, you may have that player attempt to block with defense.

If a pass comes within a player you control’s defensive range, you may have that player attempt to steal using defense.

Cards can be played from your hand at ‘action-speed’ or at ‘reaction speed’.
Action speed cards cost 1 action point to play and cannot be play while resolving a reaction stack
Reaction speed cards be played in response to any player (including the action-taking player). The player to the left of the player that took the action has the first opportunity to react, passing priority to the left until all players decide not to take a reaction. A player passing on their opportunity to react may still react at a later opportunity in the same stack.
Once no player wants to play reaction cards we resolve the cards in the order they were played. 

Actions that cause a Player to do something will generally contain the phrase “exhaust player”, this means that Actions that contain the phrase “exhaust player” can no longer target that player until your next upkeep phase.

Action-speed cards are:
Standard Actions
‘Play Cards’ - (eg Pick n’ roll, lets you do multiple actions for one, could do things like draw more cards or manipulate deck)
Coaching - (card draw, deck manipulation, temporary buffs, extra actions)
Team Assets - Cards that provide permanent buffs or allow you to take 


Turn:
(before first turn) - draw 5 cards, discard upto 5 cards and redraw the same number
(upkeep) - turn over exhausted cards then activate ‘beginning of turn’ abilities, player orders these triggers, you cannot react to ‘beginning of turn’ abilities.
(actions) - By default players have 3 actions, cards may provide additional actions. 
	Discard 2 cards to take any standard action
	Play an Action Speed Card from hand
	Activate player abilities that say “Exhaust player, x Action(s)”
	Active team assets that say “Exhaust staff, x Action(s)”
	Move a player



Uses “stack” rules like MTG

Player Cards have stats:
Size: Big/Mid/Small
Speed
Shooting
Passing
Dribbling
Defense
Deck Size(? - yes for now)

Player cards sit on top of ability cards which stick out from the bottom
LIke the mutate mechanic in MTF?

Progression Ideas
New Abilities
‘Splay’ Abilities (similar to innovation), progression lets you push an ability card up/down left/right to expose new abilities and/or stat changes

Increase Stats

Board:
Board is a full basketball court, length width tbh. uses hexes

Deck:
Both constructed and draft based
Cards should have rarities for the draft version

Player draft, then ability draft, then deck draft?

Team size:
3 Starters
N bench players
