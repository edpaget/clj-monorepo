## Triggering Injuries

When you succeed on a Screen/Check, compare your Fate reveal to the difficulty:

| Margin of Success | Effect |
|-------------------|--------|
| Success by 0-1 | Normal Check (both ↷, target skips unexhaust) |
| Success by 2-3 | Injure attempt triggered → target may Brace |
| Success by 4+ | Automatic injury (no Brace allowed) |

## Brace

When an Injure attempt is triggered (margin 2-3), the target reveals Fate with Advantage or Disadvantage based on their size:

| Size | Effect |
|------|--------|
| SM | Normal |
| MD | Advantage |
| LG | Double Advantage |

If the revealed Fate ≥ attacker's margin, injury is avoided. Normal Check effects still apply.

## Substitution

- Injured players are removed for the rest of the game
- During post-score repositioning, you may substitute any team players with bench players
- Substitutions made outside of post-score repositioning enter exhausted
