## Setup

1. Determine who is the Home team and who is the Away team (could be a coin flip)
2. The Home team places their starters first
3. One player from each team must be placed inside the Center Circle to contest the tip-off
4. The other two players may be placed anywhere in your half of the court

After both teams have been placed, play proceeds to the Tip-off.

## Tip-Off

Both Players Reveal Fate with Advantage or Disadvantage based on size comparison. The player with the higher fate wins the tip-off.

| Your Size vs Opponent | Effect |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Larger | Advantage |
| Same size | Normal |
| Smaller | Disadvantage |

The winner of the tip-off:
- May place the ball with any of their players who are not in the center circle
- Acts first

## Turn Structure

A turn consists of three phases:

### 1. Upkeep

All of your exhausted players become unexhausted.

### 2. Main

During the main phase you may do any of the following in any order, any number of times:

| Action | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Move a player up to their Speed | Free |
| Play a card | Discard 1 card from hand |
| Use a Standard Action | Discard 3 cards from hand |

**Movement:** You may move any of your players at any time during your main phase. Movement is free—it doesn't cost any cards or cause exhaustion. Move as many players as you want, each up to their Speed stat.

**Playing Cards:** To play a card, discard 1 card from your hand (this is the "fuel" for the play). When you discard a Coaching card as fuel, its Signal effect triggers.

**Standard Actions:** Standard Actions cost 3 cards discarded from hand instead of 1.

### 3. Draw

Draw 3 cards from your deck. If you have more than 8 cards in hand, discard down to 8.

## Hand Management

Your hand persists between turns—you keep unplayed cards. The hand limit is 8 cards (discard down at end of turn if over).

### Drawing Cards

| Source | When |
|--------|------|
| End of turn | Draw 3 cards |
| Succeed by 2+ on any action | Draw 1 card immediately |
| Opponent scores | Draw 2 cards immediately |
| Card effects | As printed |

## Scoring

Baskets can either be worth 2 or 3 points:

- **2 Points:** Shots from the first 4 hexes from the end of the board
- **3 Points:** Shots from any further distance

### After Scoring

After a basket is scored:

1. The defending team takes possession of the ball
2. The defending player begins a new turn — even if the basket was scored during their previous turn
3. Each player may move one of their team players up to their movement speed ignoring zones of control
4. Each player may substitute any team players with bench players
5. All players are unexhausted

## Game Structure

The game is divided into **4 quarters**. Each quarter consists of **6 turns per player** (12 turns total per quarter).

### Between Quarters

At the end of each quarter:

1. All players are unexhausted
2. Each player may substitute any team players with bench players
3. Possession alternates (team that started the previous quarter defends first)

### Halftime

Between quarters 2 and 3, in addition to the standard quarter break:

1. Each player may move one of their team players up to their movement speed ignoring zones of control

## End of Game

The game ends after the 4th quarter. The team with the highest score wins.

### Overtime

If the score is tied at the end of the 4th quarter, play continues with overtime periods of **2 turns per player** until one team leads at the end of an overtime period.
