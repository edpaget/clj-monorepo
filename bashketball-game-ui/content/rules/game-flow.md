## Setup

1. Determine who is the Home team and who is the Away team (could be a coin flip)
2. The Home team places their starters first
3. One player from each team must be placed inside the Center Circle to contest the tip-off
4. The other two players may be placed anywhere in your half of the court

After both teams have been placed, play proceeds to the Tip-off.

## Tip-Off

Both Players Reveal Fate with Advantage or Disadvantage based on size comparison. The player with the higher fate wins the tip-off.

| Your Size vs Opponent | Effect |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Larger | Advantage |
| Same size | Normal |
| Smaller | Disadvantage |

The winner of the tip-off:
- May place the ball with any of their players who are not in the center circle
- Acts first

## Turn Structure

A turn consists of five Phases:

### 1. Upkeep

Cards controlled by this player that were exhausted are now no longer exhausted. At the end of this phase the acting player gains **3 Actions** and draws **5 Cards**.

### 2. Start of Turn

During this phase any cards with text "At the beginning of your turn" or "At the beginning of your opponent's turn" trigger. Cards owned by the acting player trigger first in whatever order the acting player wishes, then their opponent chooses the order their triggers resolve in (if they have any).

### 3. Actions

In the main part of a turn a player may take their actions. An action can be used to do one of four things:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Move a Player** | Move up to their movement speed. |
| **Play a Card** | Costs at least 1 action. Some cards may specify additional action costs. |
| **Take a Standard Action** | Spend 1 Action + discard 2 cards to use any Standard Action. |
| **Pay Asset/Ability Costs** | Use effects that say "Spend 1 Action: Effect". Only during Action phase. |

### 4. Discard

The acting player loses their remaining actions and discards unplayed cards from their hand. Cards with "On discard" effects trigger in this phase.

### 5. End of Turn

During this phase any cards with text "At the end of your turn" or "At the end of your opponent's turn" trigger. Cards owned by the acting player trigger first in whatever order the acting player wishes, then their opponent chooses the order their triggers resolve in (if they have any).

## Scoring

Baskets can either be worth 2 or 3 points:

- **2 Points:** Shots from the first 4 hexes from the end of the board
- **3 Points:** Shots from any further distance

### After Scoring

After a basket is scored:

1. The defending team takes possession of the ball
2. The defending player begins a new turn — even if the basket was scored during their previous turn
3. Each player may move one of their team players up to their movement speed ignoring zones of control
4. Each player may substitute any team players with bench players
5. All players are unexhausted

## Game Structure

The game is divided into **4 quarters**. Each quarter consists of **6 turns per player** (12 turns total per quarter).

### Between Quarters

At the end of each quarter:

1. All players are unexhausted
2. Each player may substitute any team players with bench players
3. Possession alternates (team that started the previous quarter defends first)

### Halftime

Between quarters 2 and 3, in addition to the standard quarter break:

1. Each player may move one of their team players up to their movement speed ignoring zones of control

## End of Game

The game ends after the 4th quarter. The team with the highest score wins.

### Overtime

If the score is tied at the end of the 4th quarter, play continues with overtime periods of **2 turns per player** until one team leads at the end of an overtime period.
