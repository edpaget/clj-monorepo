description: "How players exert influence over adjacent hexes"
order: 3
---

Players exert a Zone of Control (ZoC) in a one hex radius. Actions by other players are affected by this ZoC:

- Moves through a ZoC cost extra movement points for each opponent's ZoC you are moving through
- Attempting to shoot while within a ZoC gives a penalty (depending on player size)
- A pass that travels through a ZoC also gives a penalty for each ZoC it moves through (depending on player size)

**Important:** Exhausted players do not exert a Zone of Control.

## Movement Through ZoC

Moving through an opponent's Zone of Control costs extra movement points.

| Defender Size | Moving Player Size | Additional Movement Cost |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| SM | SM | +1 |
| SM | MD | +0 |
| SM | LG | +0 |
| MD | SM | +2 |
| MD | MD | +1 |
| MD | LG | +0 |
| LG | SM | +2 |
| LG | MD | +2 |
| LG | LG | +1 |

## Shooting in ZoC

Attempting to shoot while within an opponent's Zone of Control applies a penalty to the Shot (SHT) skill test.

| Defender Size | Shooter Size | Shot Modifier |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| SM | SM | -1 |
| SM | MD | +0 |
| SM | LG | +0 |
| MD | SM | -2 |
| MD | MD | -1 |
| MD | LG | +0 |
| LG | SM | -3 |
| LG | MD | -2 |
| LG | LG | -1 |

## Passing Through ZoC

Each opponent's Zone of Control the ball travels through applies a penalty to the Pass (PSS) skill test.

| Defender Size | Passer Size | Pass Modifier (per ZoC) |
|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
| SM | SM | -1 |
| SM | MD | -2 |
| SM | LG | -2 |
| MD | SM | 0 |
| MD | MD | -1 |
| MD | LG | -2 |
| LG | SM | 0 |
| LG | MD | 0 |
| LG | LG | -1 |

## Setting a Screen

Players of one team can cancel out the ZoC of players from another team by setting a Screen. A player has set a screen when they are adjacent to a player of the opposing team and they are not a SM vs a LG player.
