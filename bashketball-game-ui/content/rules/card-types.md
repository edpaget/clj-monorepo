## Player

Player cards represent players on your team. They are not part of your deck. At the beginning of a game, you will choose three player cards to place as your starters. The rest of the players are your bench. Player cards can have "Ability cards" attached to them.

Player cards have:
- **Shot stat** — shooting ability
- **Pass stat** — passing ability
- **Defense stat** — defensive ability
- **Size** — SM, MD, or LG
- **Speed** — how far they can move
- **Minimum deck cards** — cards required in your deck to include this player

## Team Asset

Team assets represent special capabilities of your basketball team. They are played onto the board in the Team asset area. Team assets may provide passive abilities, triggered abilities, or abilities that require a cost to use.

Some Team assets may have a special subtype **Response** where you play them face-down. You have an opportunity to use a response during a window after you or your opponent have a trigger fire, use an ability, or use an action.

## Play

Play represents basketball action. It will usually direct you to move one or more of your players.

### Split Play

Some play cards may have more than one option on them written as **Offense** and **Defense**. When these cards are played you may choose one of the two options.

## Standard Action

There are three standard action cards — Shoot / Block, Pass / Steal, and Drive / Check. You can use an unlimited number of standard action cards in your deck construction.

## Coaching

Coaching cards represent how you inspire, lead, or give tactical directions to your players. They will provide bonuses to actions or interact with your player's abilities or your team assets.

## Ability

These cards give your players new Abilities, which much like assets can give your player passive bonuses or actions they can perform.
