## Player

Player cards represent players on your team. They are not part of your deck. At the beginning of a game, you will choose three player cards to place as your starters. The rest of the players are your bench. Player cards can have "Ability cards" attached to them.

Player cards have:
- **Shot stat** — shooting ability
- **Pass stat** — passing ability
- **Defense stat** — defensive ability
- **Size** — SM, MD, or LG
- **Speed** — how far they can move
- **Minimum deck cards** — cards required in your deck to include this player

## Team Asset

Team assets represent special capabilities of your basketball team. They are played onto the board in the Team asset area. Team assets may provide passive abilities, triggered abilities, or abilities that require a cost to use.

Some Team assets may have a special subtype **Response** where you play them face-down. You have an opportunity to use a response during a window after you or your opponent have a trigger fire, use an ability, or use an action.

## Play

Play represents basketball action. It will usually direct you to move one or more of your players. When you play a Play card, discard 1 card from your hand as fuel.

### Split Play

Some play cards may have more than one option on them written as **Offense** and **Defense**. When these cards are played you may choose one of the two options.

## Standard Action

There are three standard action cards — Shoot / Block, Pass / Steal, and Screen / Check. You can use an unlimited number of standard action cards in your deck construction.

You can also use any Standard Action without the card by discarding 3 cards from your hand.

## Coaching

Coaching cards have two modes: **Call** and **Signal**.

| Mode | When It Triggers | Effect Size |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| **Call** | Play the card normally (costs 1 discard) | Larger effect |
| **Signal** | Discard as fuel for another card | Smaller effect |

### Call Mode

When you play a Coaching card for its Call effect, discard 1 card from your hand as fuel (same as any other card). The Call effect is the primary, larger effect of the card.

### Signal Mode

When you discard a Coaching card as fuel for another card, its Signal effect triggers before the main card resolves. Signals are smaller, quick effects.

### Signal Rules

1. Signals only trigger when discarded as fuel for another card
2. Signals resolve before the Play card's effect
3. Multiple Signals can stack on one Play
4. Play cards discarded as fuel have no Signal effect (only Coaching cards do)
5. You cannot use Signal without playing another card

### Example

**Hand:** Pick and Pop, Quick Release, Box Out, Hustle Back

**Play:**
1. Play **Pick and Pop** (a Play card)
2. Discard **Quick Release** as fuel — Signal triggers: +1 SHT to next Shot
3. Pick and Pop resolves: Gorath sets screen, Brennan shoots at +1 SHT

## Ability

These cards give your players new Abilities, which much like assets can give your player passive bonuses or actions they can perform.
