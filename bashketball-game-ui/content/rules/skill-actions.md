## Shoot

A shot is an attempt to score on one of the basket hexes. Cards may target a team player to attempt a shot.

A shot is resolved by:

1. Taking a player's Shot stat
2. Adding or subtracting any bonuses provided by cards
3. Determining Advantage/Disadvantage from Zones of Control

The final stat is subtracted from 8 giving the Shot difficulty. The player then reveals fate (applying any Advantage or Disadvantage) and must show a number greater than or equal to the shot difficulty.

## Pass

A pass is an attempt to send the ball to a teammate. Cards may target one team player who controls the ball and another team player who will receive the ball.

A pass is resolved by:

1. Taking a player's Pass stat
2. Adding or subtracting any bonuses provided by cards
3. Determining Advantage/Disadvantage from Zones of Control in the pass path

The final stat is subtracted from 8 giving the Pass difficulty. The player then reveals fate (applying any Advantage or Disadvantage) and must show a number greater than or equal to the pass difficulty.

## Distance

Both shooting and passing are affected by distance:

| Range | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Close (1-2 hexes) | Advantage |
| Medium (3-4 hexes) | Normal |
| Long (5+ hexes) | Disadvantage |

## Defense

A defensive action is a check or steal attempt where a defender proactively attempts to interfere with an opponent. Cards causing a defensive action may target one player on the defender's team and another player on the offensive team.

A defensive action is resolved by:

1. Taking a player's Defense stat
2. Adding or subtracting any bonuses provided by cards
3. Determining Advantage/Disadvantage from size comparison with the target

The stat is subtracted from 8 giving the defensive action difficulty. The player then reveals fate (applying any Advantage or Disadvantage) and must show a number greater than or equal to the defensive action difficulty.

| Defender vs Target | Effect |
|--------------------|--------|
| Larger | Advantage |
| Same size | Normal |
| Smaller | Disadvantage |
