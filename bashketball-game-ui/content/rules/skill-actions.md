## Shoot

A shot is an attempt to score on one of the basket hexes. Cards may target a team player to attempt a shot.

A shot is resolved by:

1. Taking a player's Shot stat
2. Adding the distance modifier from the basket hex
3. Adding or subtracting any bonuses provided by cards
4. Factoring in any defender's Zones of Control

The final number is then subtracted from 8 giving the Shot difficulty. The player then reveals fate and must show a number greater than or equal to the shot difficulty.

## Pass

A pass is an attempt to send the ball to a teammate. Cards may target one team player who controls the ball and another team player who will receive the ball.

A pass is resolved by:

1. Taking a player's Pass stat
2. Adding the distance modifier between the players
3. Adding or subtracting any bonuses provided by cards
4. Factoring in any defender's Zones of Control

The final number is then subtracted from 8 giving the Pass difficulty. The player then reveals fate and must show a number greater than or equal to the pass difficulty.

## Distance Modifiers

Both shooting and passing use the same distance modifiers:

| Distance | Modifier |
|----------|----------|
| Adjacent | +2 |
| 2 hexes | +1 |
| 3 hexes | +0 |
| 4 hexes | -1 |
| 5 hexes | -2 |
| 6+ hexes | -3 |

## Defense

A defensive action is a check or steal attempt where a defender proactively attempts to interfere with an opponent. Cards causing a defensive action may target one player on the defender's team and another player on the offensive team.

A defensive action is resolved by:

1. Taking a player's Defense stat
2. Subtracting any ZoC imposed by players other than the target
3. Adding or subtracting any bonuses provided by cards

This number is subtracted from 8 and gives the defensive action difficulty. The player then reveals fate and must show a number greater than or equal to the defensive action difficulty.
