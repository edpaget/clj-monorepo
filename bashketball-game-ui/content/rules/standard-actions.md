## Exhaust

Some actions may cause a Team Player to become Exhausted (↷). An exhausted player does not exert Zone of Control. This creates real decisions: commit to a block/steal and lose ZoC, or hold position to maintain ZoC coverage.

During a player's Upkeep phase, all of their exhausted players become unexhausted.
