## Actions

An Action is a unit a player can spend to Move, Play Cards, take Standard Actions, or pay asset or ability costs. Generally it costs one action to do either, but some cards may specify that they cost additional actions to play.

## Skills

Players have three skills: **Shot (SHT)**, **Pass (PSS)**, and **Defense (DEF)**. These skills range from 1-7. To succeed a skill test, a player must Reveal Fate greater than or equal to 8 minus the Skill.

| Skill Value | Required Fate |
|-------------|---------------|
| 7 | 1+ |
| 6 | 2+ |
| 5 | 3+ |
| 4 | 4+ |
| 3 | 5+ |
| 2 | 6+ |
| 1 | 7+ |

## Fate

Skill tests are resolved by Revealing Fate. The player testing the skill will reveal the top card of their deck. The Fate of the card is the number in the top right corner of the card which can be 0-8.

## Player Size

Players can be **Small (SM)**, **Medium (MD)**, or **Large (LG)**. Differences in size between players contesting actions can give players bonuses to their skill, negatives to their skill, or cause players to have:

- **Advantage** — reveal fate twice and select the best Fate number
- **Disadvantage** — reveal fate twice and select the worst Fate number
