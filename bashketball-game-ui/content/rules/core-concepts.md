## Card Economy

Cards are your primary resource. There is no separate action pool—everything you do costs cards.

| Action | Cost |
|--------|------|
| Move a player | Free (no exhaust) |
| Play a card | Discard 1 card from hand |
| Use a Standard Action | Discard 3 cards from hand |

Every card matters—it can be played for its effect OR discarded as fuel for another card. When discarding a Coaching card as fuel, its Signal effect triggers (see Card Types).

### Hand Limit

Your hand persists between turns. The maximum hand size is 8 cards. At the end of your turn, if you have more than 8 cards, discard down to 8.

## Exhaustion

Playing cards that cause basketball actions (shots, passes, checks) exhausts the acting player. Exhausted players do NOT exert Zone of Control. Players unexhaust during their controller's Upkeep phase.

| Situation | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| Defender is unexhausted | Has ZoC, threatens passing lanes and shots |
| Defender attempts block/steal | Becomes exhausted, loses ZoC, creates gap |
| Defender holds position | Keeps ZoC but hasn't actively contested |
| Screen succeeds | Both players exhaust, creating gaps in coverage |

## Skills

Players have three skills: **Shot (SHT)**, **Pass (PSS)**, and **Defense (DEF)**. These skills range from 1-7. To succeed a skill test, a player must Reveal Fate greater than or equal to 8 minus the Skill.

| Skill Value | Required Fate |
|-------------|---------------|
| 7 | 1+ |
| 6 | 2+ |
| 5 | 3+ |
| 4 | 4+ |
| 3 | 5+ |
| 2 | 6+ |
| 1 | 7+ |

### Succeeding by 2+

When you succeed on a skill test by 2 or more (your revealed Fate exceeds the difficulty by 2+), you immediately draw 1 card.

## Fate

Skill tests are resolved by Revealing Fate. The player testing the skill will reveal the top card of their deck. The Fate of the card is the number in the top right corner of the card which can be 0-8.

## Player Size

Players can be **Small (SM)**, **Medium (MD)**, or **Large (LG)**. Differences in size between players contesting actions can give players bonuses to their skill, negatives to their skill, or cause players to have:

- **Advantage** — reveal fate twice and select the best Fate number
- **Disadvantage** — reveal fate twice and select the worst Fate number
